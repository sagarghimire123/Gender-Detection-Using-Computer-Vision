# Gender-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
This is a project which utilizes ML and Computer Vision tools to detect genders based on trained images. In this project we have applied various Computer Vision technique to enhance and sharpen the images that are of low pixels and quality. After preprocessing of images we extracted various features such as LPB and HOG from each images and created a dataframe containing information for each images. The dataframe is then used to train with SVM, LGBM and other models based on various sizes such as 32x32, 64x64, 256x256 and with and without filter(no preprocessing).
